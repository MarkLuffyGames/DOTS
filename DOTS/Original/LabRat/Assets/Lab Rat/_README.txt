You're the black arrow.

The CPUs are blue, green, and red arrows.

Your "homebase" is the cylinder of your color.

Click on tiles in the direction you want to make nudge arrows (or use WASD while hovering).

Nudge the walking spheres into your homebase! your sphere count will increase by one for each.

Watch out for orange boxes--they eat spheres, and will remove 30% of your sphere count!

Collect the most spheres in your homebase by the time the timer runs out to win!
